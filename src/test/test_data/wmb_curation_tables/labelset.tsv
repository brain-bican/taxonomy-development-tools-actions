neurotransmitter	Clusters are assigned based on the average expression of both neurotransmitter transporter genes and key neurotransmitter synthesizing enzyme genes.	None					
class	The top level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. It is primarily determined by broad brain region and neurotransmitter type. All cells within a subclass belong to the same class. Class provides a broader categorization of cell types.	3					
subclass	The coarse level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. All cells within a supertype belong to the same subclass. Subclass groups together related supertypes.	2					
supertype	The second finest level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. All cells within a cluster belong to the same supertype. Supertype groups together similar clusters.	1					
cluster	The finest level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. Cells within a cluster share similar characteristics and belong to the same supertype.	0
